# **Crop Protection Using Deep Learning and Raspberry Pi**

## **Overview**

This project focuses on developing a crop protection system that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for disease detection with a Raspberry Pi for deployment. The system aims to monitor crop health in real-time, detecting diseases through image analysis to enable timely interventions and protect crop yields.

## **Features**

- **CNN-Based Disease Detection:** Utilizes CNNs to accurately identify crop diseases from images.
- **Raspberry Pi Integration:** Deploys the deep learning model on a Raspberry Pi for edge computing and real-time monitoring.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Provides continuous surveillance of crop health to detect and address issues promptly.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Offers a simple interface for monitoring and managing crop health data.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
- **Version Control:** Git

## **Usage**

1. **Deploy on Raspberry Pi:** Follow setup instructions to deploy the model on the Raspberry Pi.
2. **Monitor Crops:** Use the system to capture images of crops and analyze them for disease detection.
3. **Receive Alerts:** The system will notify users if diseases are detected, enabling prompt action.

## **Dataset**

- The model was trained on a dataset of crop images with various disease types.
- Due to dataset size, it is not included in this repository. Instructions for preparing and using your dataset are in the `data` directory.

## **Results**

- The system effectively detects crop diseases with high accuracy and provides timely alerts for intervention.
- Detailed performance metrics and visual results are available in the `results` directory.

## **Contributing**

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request or open an Issue for any suggestions or improvements.


## **Acknowledgements**
